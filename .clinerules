# Loyal Leads Project Rules

## Coding Patterns

### Component Structure
- Components are organized by functionality, not by page
- UI components are kept simple and focused on presentation
- Feature components handle business logic and state
- Layout components manage page structure and composition

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for component names (e.g., `ContactForm.jsx`)
- camelCase for utility functions and variables
- Descriptive, purpose-based naming for all elements
- Avoid abbreviations in component and function names

### File Organization
- Components live in `/src/components/`
- Pages use Next.js App Router in `/src/app/`
- Utility functions in `/src/lib/`
- Static assets in `/public/` and `/src/images/`

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS for most styling needs
- CSS modules for component-specific styling
- Consistent color palette and spacing
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Development Workflow

### Feature Implementation
1. Understand requirements fully before coding
2. Create or modify components as needed
3. Implement functionality with appropriate error handling
4. Test across different device sizes
5. Document any API integrations or special considerations

### API Integration
- API routes in `/src/app/api/[endpoint]/route.js`
- Environment variables for sensitive information
- Error handling for all API calls
- Revalidation patterns for dynamic content

### Content Management
- MDX for blog posts and documentation
- Content API for dynamic content updates
- Consistent metadata structure for all content
- Proper image optimization for all media

## Project Preferences

### Code Style
- Clean, readable code over clever solutions
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Meaningful comments for complex logic
- Proper error handling throughout

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images and large assets
- Minimize client-side JavaScript where possible
- Use appropriate Next.js rendering strategies
- Consider loading states for async operations

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

This document captures the key patterns, preferences, and project intelligence for the Loyal Leads website. It will be updated as new patterns emerge or existing ones evolve.
