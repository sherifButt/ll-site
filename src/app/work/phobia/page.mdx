## Overview 

Super Docs was born from the need for a more integrated and visually appealing documentation solution for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Recognizing the limitations of existing tools, the team envisioned a platform that could seamlessly blend technical documentation with modern design and interactivity.

The project kicked off with a deep dive into the needs of developers and technical writers, leading to the integration of Swagger for open API documentation, Mermaid for creating engaging diagrams, and auto change-log for tracking project evolution. The result is a documentation toolbox that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of its users.
